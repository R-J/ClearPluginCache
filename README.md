ClearPluginCache
================

Plugin for Vanilla forum that is just a little helper for caching quirks
  
Sometimes when I upload a new plugin, I cannot see it in the list at /settings/plugins/all. This is a caching problem in my configuration but writing that plugin was more easy than finding the right caching configuration ;-)
